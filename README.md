# Simple Equal Heights

Originally sourced from [Equal height by Lewi Hussey](http://codepen.io/Lewitje/pen/YybQEP) and upgraded to work on multiple divs at once.
A simple plugin that sets responsive equal heights by simply adding attributes directly to the mark up. [download to view the demo Â»](https://github.com/BurfieldCreative/equal-heights/).


# How to Use

Group anything that needs an equal height by adding the attribute data-match-height=[groupName].
It evens works on nested divs etc.

<pre>
<div class='class-name'>
    <div data-match-height="groupName1"></div>
    <div data-match-height="groupName1"></div>
    <div data-match-height="groupName1"></div>
</div>

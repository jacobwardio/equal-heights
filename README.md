# Simple Equal Heights

Originally sourced from [Equal height by Burfield Hussey](http://codepen.io/Lewitje/pen/YybQEP) and upgraded to work on multiple divs at once.
A simple plugin that sets responsive equal heights by simply adding attributes directly to the mark up.

[Download to view the [demo](https://github.com/BurfieldCreative/equal-heights/).


# How to Use

Group ANYTHING that needs an equal height by adding the attribute data-match-height=[groupName].
It evens works on nested divs etc. Even works on images (although they get stretched a touch see [demo](https://github.com/BurfieldCreative/equal-heights/))

```
<div class='class-name'>
    <div data-match-height="groupName1"></div>
    <div data-match-height="groupName1"></div>
    <div data-match-height="groupName1"></div>
</div>
```
